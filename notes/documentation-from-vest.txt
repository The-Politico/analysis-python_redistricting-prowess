Alabama
-------
Election results from the Alabama Secretary of State Elections Division (https://www.sos.alabama.gov/alabama-votes/voter/election-data).

Absentee and provisional ballots were reported countywide in all counties. These were distributed by candidate to precincts based on their share of the precinct-level reported vote.

Precinct shapefiles initially from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2020 Redistricting Data Program final release, except the following counties use shapefiles sourced from the respective county governments instead: Baldwin, Blount, Calhoun, Cullman, DeKalb, Franklin, Jefferson, Lee, Limestone, Madison, Marengo, Marshall, Mobile, Morgan, St. Clair, Shelby, Talladega, Tuscaloosa.

Precinct boundaries were adjusted as appropriate to align with county maps, municipal boundaries, or commission districts. Precinct boundaries throughout the state were further reviewed with the voter registration file in effect for the November 2020 general election. Voting districts in nearly all counties were edited accordingly to align with reporting units in the 2020 election results. In many counties the resulting boundaries bear little resemblance to the 2020 Census VTDs. As these boundary revisions were so extensive only splits and merges are specified below by precinct.

Many precincts have outdated names in the Census VTDs. The Census VTDs also have at least some precinct names in wrong locations for the following counties: Clarke, Clay, Cleburne, Conecuh, Dallas, Escambia, Geneva, Greene, Jefferson, Lauderdale, Limestone, Marion, Marshall, Monroe, Perry, Randolph, Russell, Tallapoosa, Walker, Washington, Wilcox. Moreover, many precinct numbers and consequently the VTD GeoIDs are also incorrect throughout much of the state in the Census shapefiles. All precinct names and numbers have been edited to match the 2020 voter file.

The following splits and merges were made to align voting district boundaries with reporting units in the 2020 election results.

Barbour: Split Eufaula between Bevill/CC/Fellowship/McCoo/Sanford/WB
Calhoun: Add precinct splits to Beats 1, 4, 5, 9, 12, 13, 15, 19, 22

Precinct shapefile from Alaska Division of Elections (http://www.elections.alaska.gov/Core/districtmaps.php)

Early, Absentee, and Questioned votes are only reported at the State House district level (since Alaska has portions of the state with no lower level of government, HDs serve a similar purpose as counties do in other states for the purpose of reporting votes). These votes are apportioned to precincts by candidate in the same shares that the Election Day vote was split among precincts within an HD. Similarly, federal-only ballots that are reported at the statewide level were apportioned to precincts by candidate based on their share of the precinct-level vote.

Arkansas
--------
Election results from Arkansas Secretary of State (https://www.sos.arkansas.gov/elections/research/election-results)

Precinct shapefile from the Arkansas GIS Office (http://gis.arkansas.gov/product/election-precincts/)

Greene County was consolidated from 24 townships to 6 townships by court order in late 2019. Due to the proximity of the 2020 elections the results were reported by ballot type rather than by precincts based on the prior township map. The associated precinct parts were identified using the voter statistics report provided by the county. The relevant splits involve the state house districts, a Justice of the Peace district, and two school districts. Note also that in the general election results from the AR Secretary of State one of the reporting units in the new Bagwell Lake township is mislabeled as Crowley Ridge 3.

Precinct merges were made in the following counties to match county reporting units: Carroll, Crittenden, Dallas, Hot Spring, Howard, Independence, Mississippi, Monroe, Nevada, Phillips, Poinsett, St. Francis.

The following additional revisions were made to match the 2020 precinct boundaries.

Boone: Add precinct splits with municipal and district boundaries on county map
Greene: Align Paragould city wards with city PDF
Izard: Split Sage in Melbourne 4 and Oxford in Brockwell with township shapefile
Nevada: Split West Rural by township
Ouachita: Split 11/19 with township and state house district shapefiles
Phillips: Add Helena-West Helena wards from city redistricting map
Prairie: Split White River Country with school zone shapefile
Sebastian: Split 9-2A and 9-2C by Greenwood city ward

Colorado
--------
Election results from the Colorado Secretary of State (https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Results/Archives.html)
Precinct shapefiles primarily from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2020 Redistricting Data Program. The following counties used shapefiles sourced from the respective county governments instead: Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, Delta, Denver, Douglas, El Paso, Fremont, Garfield, Gilpin, Jefferson, La Plata, Larimer, Mesa, Pitkin, Pueblo, Summit, Weld.

Las Animas County precinct assignments in the voter file differ markedly from both the Census VTD boundaries and from maps received from the county. All precincts were revised to match the geocoded voter file and the list of districts assigned to precinct splits. As appropriate, precinct boundaries were revised using Census blocks, the Trinidad municipal boundary shapefile, school district or fire district boundaries, and the parcel shapefile from the Las Animas County Assessor.

The following additional revisions were made to match the 2020 precinct boundaries:

Logan: Align Sterling City precincts with city limits
Montezuma: Precincts renumbered to match county maps
Morgan: Split Precincts 1/18 to match county maps
Otero: Align La Junta City precincts with county maps

Florida
-------
Election results from the Florida Department of State (https://dos.myflorida.com/elections/data-statistics/elections-data/precinct-level-election-results/)

Precinct results from several sources.
Alachua, Bay, Bradford, Brevard, Calhoun, Citrus, Clay, Dixie, Escambia, Hardee, Hendry, Hernando, Indian River, Lafayette and Sarasota come from the Department of State.
Broward, Gadsden, Gilchrist, Manatee, Nassau, Santa Rosa, St. Johns, St. Lucie, and Union are from the Orlando Sentinel's precinct map for the 2016 presidential primary (http://interactive.orlandosentinel.com/elections/2016/presidential-primary/results/dem.html).
Baker, Charlotte, Franklin, Glades, Holmes, Jackson, Jefferson, Levy, Liberty, Madison, Monroe, Okeechobee, Orange, Seminole, Suwannee, Taylor, Wakulla, Walton, and Washinton come from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2020 Redistricting Data Program.
Collier, Columbia, DeSoto, Duval, Flagler, Gulf, Highlands, Hillsborough, Lake, Lee, Leon, Marion, Martin, Miami-Dade, Okaloosa, Osceola, Palm Beach, Pasco, Pinellas, Polk, Putnam, Sumter, and Volusia come from the counties.
Hamilton was drawn based on a geocoded voter registration file.
Edits were made to Brevard, Charlotte, Escambia, Franklin, Indian River, Jefferson, Lafayette, Lake, and Lee, Miami-Dade, and St. Johns based on the voter registration file.

Lake 108, Osceola 999, Palm Beach 8002, Seminole 900s, and Monroe's "Cumulative" precinct (the latter appears on the county's detailed results but not the DOS's precinct results file) don't have geography. Brevard 999, Broward Z073, Collier 450, Flagler 999, Hillborough 999, Leon 9000, Miami-Dade 100, and Pinellas 512 do have geography, but they are just the county election offices. Both groups represent some type of vote not assigned to a particular geography, like UOCAVA results, so these were distributed across the county by candidate proportional to the vote each precinct recorded.

Georgia
-------
Election results from the Georgia Secretary of State Elections Division (https://sos.ga.gov/index.php/Elections/current_and_past_elections_results). Presidential recount results from the Georgia Secretary of State Elections Division via Reuters.

Precinct shapefile primarily from the Georgia General Assembly Reapportionment Office (http://www.legis.ga.gov/Joint/reapportionment/en-US/default.aspx). Cobb, DeKalb, and Gwinnett counties instead use shapefiles from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2020 Redistricting Data Program. Forsyth and Fulton use shapefiles sourced from the respective counties.

Three of the four VTDs in Chattahoochee County are comprised of Fort Benning. However, the county only reports one polling location for all voters, including residents of Fort Benning that vote within the county. The four Chattahoochee County VTDs have therefore been merged in the shapefile.

The following additional modifications reflect changes made prior to the 2020 general election.

Barrow: Merge 2/15, 3/12, 4/14, 5/7, 6/10/13, 8/9, 11/16; Adjust new 2/13 boundary

Lowndes: Split Northgate Assembly/Trinity, Jaycee/Mt Calvary/Northside/VSU
Oconee: Merge Annex/City Hall; Align City Hall with Watkinsville city limits
Paulding: Reorganize 12 precincts into 19 precincts as redrawn in 2019

Indiana
-------
Election results where available by precinct except Ohio County from the Indiana Secretary of State Election Division (https://enr.indianavoters.in.gov/site/index.html).

Election results for the following counties from county canvass reports as processed by OpenElections: Benton, Carroll, Clark, Clay, Daviess, Dubois, Fayette, Fountain, Hancock, Jackson, Jasper, Jay, Jennings, LaPorte, Lawrence, Marshall, Montgomery, Morgan, Newton, Noble, Orange, Owen, Parke, Pulaski, Randolph, Scott, Spencer, Steuben, St. Joseph, Switzerland, Tipton, Warren, Warrick.

Election results for the following counties directly from county canvass reports: Cass, Crawford, Dearborn, Floyd, Fulton, Greene, Hendricks, Ohio, Perry, Ripley, Starke, Tippecanoe, Vanderburgh, Vigo, Washington.

The canvass report from Ohio County differs from the Secretary of State precinct results for 3 precincts: Cass 7, Randolph 5, and Randolph 6. Consequently, the statewide totals differ from the final results reported on the SoS website as follows: Trump (R) +338, Biden (D) +82, Jorgensen (L) -331 for President; Rainwater (L) -66 for Governor; Rokita (R) -14 for Attorney General.

Precinct shapefile primarily from the U.S. Census Bureau's Redistricting Data Program. However, many counties featured outdated or inaccurate precinct boundaries usually related to changes in corporate boundaries. The correct 2020 precinct boundaries were identified using GIS maps from each county. As appropriate, precinct boundaries for the following counties were replaced using shapefiles from the Indiana Secretary of State Election Division or from the respective counties. Where necessary, boundaries were further edited to align with 2020 corporate boundaries as determined via county parcel records.

Adams, Allen, Bartholomew, Benton, Boone, Carroll, Cass, Clinton, Daviess, Dearborn, Decatur, Delaware, DeKalb, Elkhart, Fayette, Floyd, Fountain, Fulton, Grant, Greene, Hamilton, Huntington, Jackson, Jefferson, Johnson, Kosciusko, Lake, LaPorte, Lawrence, Marion, Monroe, Montgomery, Morgan, Perry, Porter, Posey, Rush, Scott, Shelby, Sullivan, Vanderburgh, Vermilion, Wayne, Wells.

Election results by township from Maine Bureau of Corporations, Elections & Commissions (https://www.maine.gov/sos/cec/elec/results/index.html)
Election results by ward from municipal reports for Auburn, Augusta, Belfast, Ellsworth, Gorham, Lewiston, Portland, Sanford, South Portland.

Precinct shapefiles primarily from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2020 Redistricting Data Program. Voting district shapefiles were available for Androscoggin, Cumberland, Kennebec, Sagadahoc, Waldo, York. County subdivision shapefiles were used instead for Aroostook, Franklin, Hancock, Knox, Lincoln, Oxford, Penobscot, Piscataquis, Somerset, Washington.

VTDs were merged for Bath, Brunswick, Saco, Waterville, Westbrook as statewide votes were not reported by ward. VTDs for Ellsworth and Gorham were sourced from township ward maps.

Absentee votes were reported by township for Auburn, Augusta, Ellsworth, Gorham, Lewiston, Portland, Sanford, South Portland. Military and overseas ballots (UOCAVA) were reported statewide. These were distributed by candidate to precincts based on their share of the precinct-level vote for the given reporting unit.

For Portland City the state reported 33786 votes for Joe Biden (D) and 6486 votes for Donald Trump (R). In the Senate election the state reported 28053 votes for Sara Gideon (D) and 8659 votes for Susan Collins (R). Amended precinct returns by Portland City add up to 33784 votes for Biden, 6483 votes for Trump, 28071 votes for Gideon, and 8656 votes for Collins.

Maine features more than 400 unorganized townships and islands that do not lie within municipal bounds. While some are designated separately, the U.S. Census Bureau combines most of these into larger unorganized territories within each county. Voters in unorganized townships are assigned to nearby incorporated townships. In some cases these votes are reported separately while in others they are combined into the total vote reported from the central voting location. The shapefile has been modified accordingly with boundaries from the Town Boundaries shapefile provided by the Maine Office of GIS. For unorganized territories that are unpopulated or otherwise do not appear to have any registered voters the Census boundaries have been retained unaltered.

Election results from the Michigan Secretary of State (https://miboecfr.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/cfr/precinct_srch.cgi)
Precinct shapefile from the Michigan GIS Open Data site (https://gis-michigan.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/49eb37d0a4294924bf8ef5ffe0eac47e_6/)

Some counties report "Statistical Adjustments" with their precinct results, which can either be positive or negative. Many of these are related to cities that span county lines, as they often match precinct results of these county-spanning cities. In some cases these adjustments cancel each other out across the two counties that share the city, but some (notably Clinton County's East Lansing and Eaton County's Lansing adjustments) are not reciprocated, which introduces error to statewide totals. Other than these, there appears to be a handful of tiny adjustments that were made to make the precinct totals match official countywide totals. None of these adjustments of any type were distributed to precincts, which may result in candidate totals being slightly off official totals.

Write-in vote totals have been excluded, since in most cases, a large share of their votes are accounted for via statistical adjustments.

In several cases, cities that overlapped county lines reported results in each county, but the shapefile had a single precinct. These were split at the county line in the shapefile and the two sets of results assigned accordingly.
Claire city - Isabella/Clare
Brown city - Lapeer/Sanilac
Fenton city - Oakland/Genesee
Richmond city - St. Clair/Macomb

Berrien: the results for Sodus and St. Joseph townships appear to have been flipped, these were corrected
Ottawa: via contact with the Park Township clerk's office, precinct 9 in the state shapefile has been renumbered to precinct 4
Wayne: Detroit reports absentee votes via Absent Voter Counting Boards. The linkage file of boards to precincts is from OpenElections (https://github.com/openelections/openelections-sources-mi/tree/master/2020), and votes were distributed to precincts proportionally by election day vote.

North Carolina
--------------
Election results and precinct shapefile from the NC State Board of Elections (https://www.ncsbe.gov/results-data)

Buncombe 681, Henderson CV, Wake 01-07A, 07-07A are missing from the 20201018 shapefile. They are added from the 20190827 shapefile.

North Carolina produces two sets of election results data. The precinct results are the unaltered results as initially reported by the counties. Many counties report early votes by vote center while provisional and other nonstandard ballots may be reported countywide. The precinct-sorted results are then produced within 30 days after the election. In the precinct-sorted data nearly all votes are assigned to precincts regardless of the manner by which the ballots were cast. However, North Carolina law requires the addition of statistical "noise" to the precinct-sorted data wherever any given vote by any specific voter may otherwise be deduced via cross referencing the various election-related data sets produced by the SBE.

For the 2020 general election 51 counties reported all votes by precinct in their initial precinct results. The precinct-sorted data set was used instead for the counties listed below.

Alleghany, Avery, Beaufort, Bertie*, Bladen, Buncombe, Cabarrus, Caldwell, Camden, Currituck, Dare, Davidson*, Davie, Duplin*, Durham*, Edgecombe, Guilford, Halifax*, Harnett, Haywood, Henderson, Hertford, Hyde, Johnston, Jones, Lee, Lincoln, Macon, Martin, Mecklenburg*, Moore, Nash, New Hanover*, Northampton*, Orange, Pasquotank, Pitt*, Polk, Richmond, Scotland, Stokes*, Surry*, Tyrrell*, Wake, Washington, Watauga, Wayne, Wilkes*, Yadkin

In counties marked by asterisk some votes were still reported by vote center or countywide in the precinct-sorted data. These were distributed by candidate to precincts based on the precinct-level reported vote. The precinct-sorted results were further adjusted to match the certified countywide totals based on the precinct-level vote by candidate.

Texas
-----
Election results and precinct shapefile from the Texas Legislative Council (https://data.capitol.texas.gov/). The precinct data files available for download at the TXLC Capitol Data Portal are allocated to Census VTD geography based on Voting Age Population from the 2010 Census. The unallocated precinct results and registration statistics were generously provided by TXLC staff to instead merge with the precinct boundaries.

The shapefile includes unallocated Voter Registration (VR) and Spanish Surname Voter Registration (SSVR) for the November 2020 general election. Any VR data analysis of these unallocated precinct results should utilize this unallocated VR data rather than the VR data allocated by VTD available for download at CDP. SSVR is denoted as a percentile of total VR for each precinct.

Precinct results for the following counties were replaced in whole or in part with county source files or with precinct data provided via the Secretary of State: Andrews, Bee, Borden, Brazos, Chambers, Coryell, Dawson, Deaf Smith, Donley, Fayette, Hansford, Harrison, Hood, Hudspeth, Knox, Lamar, Loving, Mason, Maverick, Reeves, Starr, Tom Green, Trinity, Waller, Wilbarger, Willacy, Williamson.

Precinct 4/6 in Gonzales was merged prior to 2008. Precinct 5/6 in Hood was merged prior to 2012. Gonzales 4 was the city of Nixon while Gonzales 6 was the surrounding county precinct. Hood 5 and 6 were divided by US Hwy 377. However, they reappear as separate line items in the 2020 general election county reports. Since these are otherwise regarded as unitary precincts and it is unclear that the separate 2020 line items correspond to the obsolete boundaries the results for Gonzales 4/6 and Hood 5/6 were combined for this shapefile.

Brazos 84 and 85 were single parcel precincts created where new construction required a distinct ballot style. Each precinct cast 2 Republican votes for all statewide races. For this shapefile the votes for Brazos 84 and 85 were added to Brazos 82 and Brazos 2 respectively based on voter registration address.

Precinct totals for the counties listed below do not add up to the Secretary of State County Canvass for one or more offices. Most commonly this is due to omission of some ballots counted after election day from either the county precinct reports or from summary results certified to the state. In some cases these involve data entry errors where numbers were transposed, dropped, or added in one or more precincts or in countywide summations. In some cases corrections to the initial precinct results were made after the certification deadline.

Anderson, Armstrong, Cass, Cochran, Cottle, Fayette, Frio, Gillespie, Hamilton, Hansford, Hood, Howard, Hudspeth, Irion, Jasper, Kent, Kleberg, Lamar, Liberty, Live Oak, Lynn, Maverick, Morris, Motley, Presidio, Reeves, Rockwall, Shackelford, Starr, Terrell, Travis, Upton, Val Verde, Van Zandt, Ward, Webb, Willacy.

Most of the discrepancies are in single digits or low double digits. The exceptions are a 140 vote overreport from Cass for David Collins (G) for U.S. Senate, a 54 vote underreport from Van Zandt for Jane Bland (R) for Supreme Court Justice 6, a 100 vote underreport from Cochran for Staci Williams (D) for Supreme Court Justice 7, a 100 vote underreport from Travis for Jeff Boyd (R) for Supreme Court Justice 7, a 274 vote overreport from Reeves for Elizabeth Frizell for Criminal Appeals Judge 3, a 286 vote underreport from Reeves for Kevin Yeary (R) for Criminal Appeals Judge 4.

Hood had an underreport of 171-176 Republican votes and 45-54 Democratic votes for all statewide races. Kleberg had an underreport of 56-71 Republican votes and 55-67 Democratic votes for all statewide races. Presidio had an underreport of 58 votes for Chrysta Casta�eda (D) for railroad commissioner, 55 votes for Amy Meachum (D) for Supreme Court Chief Justice, and 55 votes for Kathy Cheng (D) for Supreme Court Justice 6.

Votes reported countywide were distributed by candidate to precincts based on the precinct-level reported vote. This includes all early ballots in Collingsworth and Hudspeth. Early ballots for precincts 101/102, 301/303 in Donley. Mail ballots in Borden and Kimble. Federal and/or limited ballots in Bee, Bexar, Brazos, Chambers, Coryell, Harrison, Hays, and Jefferson. Provisional and military ballots in Bowie, Reeves, and Trinity.

The Mason County courthouse burned down in February 2021. The only known surviving precinct results are on a spreadsheet with an incorrect formula in place of the election day results. This was filed with the Secretary of State in 2020 and the TXLC consequently allocated all votes countywide. For this shapefile the election day votes were instead calculated as the difference between the early votes and the countywide summary totals and then distributed by candidate to precincts based on the precinct-level early vote.

In Williamson County a vendor programming error combined in person early votes to a handful of precincts for the initial results. The in person early votes were subsequently hand counted so as to be assigned to their correct precincts. A batch of about 250 ballots was not recounted before the certification deadline and thus reported only in countywide summary results. For this shapefile those in person early votes were distributed by candidate to precincts based on the precinct-level reported vote.

San Saba did not file a precinct report with the Secretary of State as required by the Texas election code and asserted they are unable to locate any precinct results for the 2020 general election. The countywide summary totals were distributed by candidate to precincts based on the 2018 precinct-level reported vote.

The following counties reported combined results for some precincts.

Election results from OpenElections (https://github.com/openelections/openelections-data-ut/tree/master/2020).
Precinct shapefile from Utah Automated Geographic Reference Center (https://gis.utah.gov/data/political/voter-precincts/).

The shapefile from the AGRC is of subprecincts, breaking down precincts in cases of district splits. In some cases, results are reported at the subprecinct level, in most cases, they weren't, so merging was done where necessary.

Emery County - 52 "canvas votes" were distributed to precincts.

Vermont
-------
Election results from the Vermont Secretary of State (https://electionarchive.vermont.gov/)
Precinct shapefile from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2020 Redistricting Data Program

The Census VTD shapefile features city wards. However, precinct boundaries for state and federal elections are not based on city wards. They are instead defined by legislative districts wherever they cross municipal boundaries. Therefore, city wards were merged in the shapefile and cities or townships were instead split into precincts wherever necessary using the state legislative district shapefile.

Vermont has four unorganized towns whose residents cast votes in neighboring towns. These were distributed back based on voting age population in the 2019 American Community Survey as 2020 Census results are not yet available at the township level. (Averill-Canaan, Buel's Gore-Huntington, Ferdinand-Brighton, Glastenbury-Shaftsbury.)
